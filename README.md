# 25-Spring-ZQC-Calculus
This is a calculus course website created for my junior. We met by chance, and I hope my tutoring will be helpful to him. In this spring semester, we will begin with basic differential equations, then move on to vector algebra and analytic geometry, multivariable calculus, and infinite series.
