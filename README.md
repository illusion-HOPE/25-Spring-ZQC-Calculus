# 25-Spring-ZQC-Calculus

This is a calculus course website created for my junior. We met by chance, and I hope my tutoring will be helpful to him. 

In this spring semester, we will begin with basic differential equations, then move on to vector algebra with analytic geometry, multivariable calculus, and infinite series. 

These topics are spread across my professional courses in Mathematical Analysis II-III, Ordinary Differential Equations, and Analytic Geometry. Some of them are areas I'm not familiar with. I hope we can make progress together.
